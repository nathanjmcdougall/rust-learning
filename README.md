# Rust Learning

This is a place for me to keep notes and tutorial examples while learning Rust.

I'm including a lot of comments in the code snippets regarding my thoughts about the language and its features, especially with reference to Python, which I'm more familiar with.

The [`REFERENCE.md`](REFERENCE.md) file contains a quick list of the reference material I'm using, feel free to make further suggestions.
